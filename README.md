# Rock Paper Scissors 🪨📝✂️

This is my very first real C project that I've ever made. It helped me learn a few very basic points in C.

## Issues I encountered...
 - **SYNTAX ERROR** -- When compiling on line 37 and 38. Exporting a string from a function is actually quite challenging! However, using * and defining the variable as a pointer seemed to fix it. Quite honestly, I've looked into this and have no idea why. I still need to research further into pointers.
 - **LOGIC ERROR** -- I faced another error that caused the script to keep generating the same random number every time I ran it. So, I used ```srand(time(NULL));``` to seed the random number generator.
 
 ## Final notes
 Please keep in mind that this is my first ever REAL C project. So most likely, it's not gonna be perfect. I'd greatly appreciate anyone contacting me via discord to give tips and other bits of help.
